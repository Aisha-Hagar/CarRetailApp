# CarRetailApp

## Problem Definition 
Assume we're improving our online car-selling platform by allowing users to add cars with images, text descriptions, and prices for a more convenient selling experience. 
User input should be converted into a structured JSON format, and the resulting data should be sent, along with the car image, to a Gmail email. All features should be extracted from the description except car type (Body Type, ex: sedan, SUV, etc.) which should be identified from the image.
